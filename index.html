<h2>What is this site for?</h2>
<p>
    This is a GitHub Pages <em>organization site</em>, created in a repository named with the pattern
    <code>org-name.github.io</code>. For Cal-ITP this is
    <a href="https://github.com/cal-itp/cal-itp.github.io">cal-itp.github.io</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Like all GitHub Pages sites, organization sites can define a
    <a href="https://github.com/cal-itp/cal-itp.github.io/blob/main/CNAME"><code>CNAME</code></a> file to customize the domain.
</p>
<p>
    An organization site serves as the root of that organization's <em>project sites</em>, which are just the other
    repositories within the organization that have GitHub Pages enabled.
</p>
<p>
    With the custom domain configured here, all Cal-ITP GitHub Pages sites are automatically available at
    <code>https://docs.calitp.org/repo-name</code>.
</p>
