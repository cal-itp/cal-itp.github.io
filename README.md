# Cal-ITP Documentation

GitHub Pages organization site serving as Cal-ITP documentation home.

Published online at <https://docs.calitp.org>

## What is this site for?

A GitHub Pages *organization site* is created in a repository named `org-name.github.io` and by default is served at that URL online.
Like all GitHub Pages sites, organization sites can define a [`CNAME`](./CNAME) file to customize the domain.

An organization site serves as the root of that organization's *project sites*, which are just the other repositories within the organization
that have GitHub Pages enabled.

With the custom domain configured here, all Cal-ITP GitHub Pages sites are automatically available at https://docs.calitp.org/repo-name:

* https://docs.calitp.org/benefits
* https://docs.calitp.org/data-infra
